# Lung Cancer Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting lung cancer based on various features and symptoms. It utilizes the Decision Tree Classifier to build the predictive model. 

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for lung cancer detection using machine learning algorithms. This model will help in predicting the likelihood of lung cancer based on demographic data and specific symptoms, such as yellow fingers, anxiety, peer pressure, chronic disease, fatigue, allergy, wheezing, alcohol consuming, coughing, shortness of breath, swallowing difficulty, and chest pain. 

We will use multiple feature selection techniques including all features, CHI-SQUARE, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to determine the best predictors for lung cancer. The model's performance will be evaluated based on precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. 

The primary goal is to enhance the early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes and survival rates. 

## Contents

The repository contains:
1. Dataset used for training and testing the model.
2. Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Usage 

You can clone the repository and run the Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks to understand the steps involved in the process. Make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed to avoid any errors. 

## Results 

The project provides a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the Decision Tree Classifier model in predicting lung cancer. It also provides insights into the importance of various features in predicting lung cancer. 

## Future Work 

The project can be extended to include other machine learning models and feature selection techniques. Moreover, the model can be trained with more diverse datasets to improve its generalization ability.
